# N-Queens Problem

An implementation of the N-Queens problem solution using the Hopfield network. Implementation is taken from [Ma≈Ñdziuk, Jacek & Macuk, Bohdan. (1992). A neural network designed to solve the N-Queens Problem. Biological Cybernetics. 66. 375-379.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220451099_A_neural_network_designed_to_solve_the_N-Queens_Problem)

This project also serves as an excuse to play around with some Fortran.
